## About the Data {#about-the-data}

This dataset is used to evaluate **investment decisions** for a company as part of a **Finance module**. The data presents **projected financial performance over a five-year period** under three different scenarios: **Best Case, Base Case, and Worst Case**.

The projections are designed to help assess the **financial viability and risk profile** of a proposed project by comparing expected outcomes under varying assumptions. This type of scenario analysis is commonly used in capital budgeting and strategic financial planning.



## What the Data Represents {#what-the-data-represents}

The visualisations illustrate the **expected investment returns over five years** for a company project under different operational conditions 

Each scenario includes the following financial metrics:

- **Revenue**:  
  Represents the total projected income generated by the project each year.

### Scenario Overview

- **Best Case**:  
  Assumes strong revenue growth, efficient cost management, and favourable market conditions, resulting in high cumulative cash flows and strong investment returns.

- **Base Case**:  
  Represents the most realistic and expected outcome based on moderate growth and stable operating conditions.

- **Worst Case**:  
  Reflects adverse conditions such as slower growth or higher costs, leading to lower profitability and increased investment risk.

Together, these scenarios provide a comprehensive view of **potential upside and downside risks**, supporting informed investment decision-making.
